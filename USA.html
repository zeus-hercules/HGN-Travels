            <h2>New York</h2>
            <img src = "Liberty.jpg">
            <p class = "p">New York City is like no other city in the world, and one that must b
                e experienced to be fully appreciated. For first-time visitors, walking the streets
                 can be like walking through a movie set, with famous sites at every turn, from the
                  Empire State Building, to Rockefeller Plaza, the Chrysler Building, Central Park,
                   Times Square, 5th Avenue, Broadway, and of course, the Statue of Liberty.

                Sightsee by day, take in a Broadway show in the evening, work in time for shopping,
                 and relax and reminisce over a fantastic meal. This is New York. With too much to
                  see and do in a day or a weekend, this is a city worth visiting time and time again.</p>

            <h2>San Fransisco</h2>
            <img src = "gate.jpg">
            <p class = "p">This charming and picturesque West Coast city is the perfect getaway destination for couples, singles, or families. Famous sites, charming streets, beautiful views, and outdoor dining are all part of what makes San Francisco such a great place to visit.
                Take a cruise on San Francisco Bay, tour Alcatraz, drive over the Golden Gate Bridge, wander around 
                Fisherman's Wharf, or hop on a street car to explore the city sites.
                Summer or fall is a wonderful time to visit, but the climate here is mild and any time of year is pleasant.</p>

            <h2>Las Vegas</h2>
            <img src = "Las Vegas.jpg"> 
            <p class = "p">This glittering city of lights in the desert holds a unique appeal, and one that has been
                 attracting visitors for decades. Huge resort complexes, with all kinds of things to see and do at any time of year
                 , have made this a destination that draws everyone, from want-to-be newlyweds who come here to say their vows, to
                  families who just want to hang out around a pool.
Entertainment options are extensive, with some of the music industry's top stars calling Las Vegas home and playing to packed 
audiences every night. Cirque du Soleil offers another unique experience, and of course, each resort has something to 
entertain guests, from dancing fountains to an erupting volcano.
                  
                When you've had your fill of the city, there is plenty to explore in the surrounding area
                , with the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, Death Valley National Park, and Valley of Fire State Park all
                 within easy day-tripping distance.
